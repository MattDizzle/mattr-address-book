POST and DELETE Requests: Assignment
Start a new project called address-book from your Express Boilerplate
This app will store contact information in the following format:
{
  id: UUID,
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  address1: String,
  address2: String,
  city: String,
  state: String,
  zip: Number
}
Create a GET route on /address that fetches all addresses
Create a POST route on /address that creates a new address
The new record should have the following validations:
id is auto generated
ALL fields except address2 are required
state must be exactly two characters
zip must be exactly a five-digit number
you DON’T need to validate if the state/zip are “real”
Create a DELETE route on /address/:id
Add Bearer Token Authorization middleware on ONLY the POST/DELETE routes
